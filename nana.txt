Here's how the code works:

1. We define a dictionary users to store usernames and passwords.
2. The login function takes a username and password as input and checks if they match the stored values in the users dictionary. If they do, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.
3. The main function is the entry point of the program. It prompts the user to enter their username and password.
4. It then calls the login function with the input values and checks the result. If the login is successful, it prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message.

Note: This is a very basic implementation and you should not use it in production without proper security measures, such as hashing and salting passwords.
